# Parser-Texas-PD
Texas still has death penalty, also you can read each sentenced to death prisoner's last statement at Police Department website https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html.
It is interesting to know what people talk about at their last time.
This parser gathhers each statement in one text file.
I want to write some script to upload txt file with statements to the wordclouds.com to make some graphic representation of the most 
popular words.
